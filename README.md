A facial expression is exhibited by the movement of muscles underneath the face skin. <br>Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions. <br>The facial expression for emotion detection has always been a challenging task in achieving through computer algorithms.<br> In the field of Artificial Intelligence, Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is an active research area, with several recent studies. With the recent advancement in computer vision and machine learning, it is possible to detect emotion from images. <br>The automatic emotion recognition based on facial expression is an interesting research field, which has presented and applied in several areas such as safety, health and in human machine interfaces.<br> The human brain recognizes emotions automatically, and software has now been developed that can recognize emotions as well. <br>This technology is becoming more accurate all the time, and will eventually be able to read emotions as well as our brains do. <br>In this project we propose a technique called facial emotion recognition using convolutional neural networks and haar cascade classifier.
